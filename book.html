<p>FROM THE AUTHOR TO THE READER</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You who so plod amid serious things that you feel it shame to give
yourself up even for a few short moments to mirth and joyousness in the
land of Fancy; you who think that life hath nought to do with innocent
laughter that can harm no one; these pages are not for you. Clap to the
leaves and go no farther than this, for I tell you plainly that if you
go farther you will be scandalized by seeing good, sober folks of real
history so frisk and caper in gay colors and motley that you would not
know them but for the names tagged to them. Here is a stout, lusty
fellow with a quick temper, yet none so ill for all that, who goes by
the name of Henry II. Here is a fair, gentle lady before whom all the
others bow and call her Queen Eleanor. Here is a fat rogue of a fellow,
dressed up in rich robes of a clerical kind, that all the good folk call
my Lord Bishop of Hereford. Here is a certain fellow with a sour temper
and a grim look—the worshipful, the Sheriff of Nottingham. And here,
above all, is a great, tall, merry fellow that roams the greenwood and
joins in homely sports, and sits beside the Sheriff at merry feast,
which same beareth the name of the proudest of the Plantagenets—Richard
of the Lion&#8217;s Heart. Beside these are a whole host of knights, priests,
nobles, burghers, yeomen, pages, ladies, lasses, landlords, beggars,
peddlers, and what not, all living the merriest of merry lives, and all
bound by nothing but a few odd strands of certain old ballads (snipped
and clipped and tied together again in a score of knots) which draw
these jocund fellows here and there, singing as they go.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here you will find a hundred dull, sober, jogging places, all tricked
out with flowers and what not, till no one would know them in their
fanciful dress. And here is a country bearing a well-known name, wherein
no chill mists press upon our spirits, and no rain falls but what rolls
off our backs like April showers off the backs of sleek drakes; where
flowers bloom forever and birds are always singing; where every fellow
hath a merry catch as he travels the roads, and ale and beer and wine
(such as muddle no wits) flow like water in a brook.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This country is not Fairyland. What is it? 'Tis the land of Fancy, and
is of that pleasant kind that, when you tire of it—whisk!—you clap the
leaves of this book together and 'tis gone, and you are ready for
everyday life, with no harm done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now I lift the curtain that hangs between here and No-man&#8217;s-land.
Will you come with me, sweet Reader? I thank you. Give me your hand.</p>

<h2 id="_how_robin_hood_came_to_be_an_outlaw">How Robin Hood Came to Be an Outlaw</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IN MERRY ENGLAND in the time of old, when good King Henry the Second
ruled the land, there lived within the green glades of Sherwood Forest,
near Nottingham Town, a famous outlaw whose name was Robin Hood. No
archer ever lived that could speed a gray goose shaft with such skill
and cunning as his, nor were there ever such yeomen as the sevenscore
merry men that roamed with him through the greenwood shades. Right
merrily they dwelled within the depths of Sherwood Forest, suffering
neither care nor want, but passing the time in merry games of archery or
bouts of cudgel play, living upon the King&#8217;s venison, washed down with
draughts of ale of October brewing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not only Robin himself but all the band were outlaws and dwelled apart
from other men, yet they were beloved by the country people round about,
for no one ever came to jolly Robin for help in time of need and went
away again with an empty fist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And now I will tell how it came about that Robin Hood fell afoul of the
law.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Robin was a youth of eighteen, stout of sinew and bold of heart,
the Sheriff of Nottingham proclaimed a shooting match and offered a
prize of a butt of ale to whosoever should shoot the best shaft in
Nottinghamshire. "Now," quoth Robin, "will I go too, for fain would I
draw a string for the bright eyes of my lass and a butt of good October
brewing." So up he got and took his good stout yew bow and a score or
more of broad clothyard arrows, and started off from Locksley Town
through Sherwood Forest to Nottingham.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was at the dawn of day in the merry Maytime, when hedgerows are green
and flowers bedeck the meadows; daisies pied and yellow cuckoo buds and
fair primroses all along the briery hedges; when apple buds blossom and
sweet birds sing, the lark at dawn of day, the throstle cock and cuckoo;
when lads and lasses look upon each other with sweet thoughts; when busy
housewives spread their linen to bleach upon the bright green grass.
Sweet was the greenwood as he walked along its paths, and bright the
green and rustling leaves, amid which the little birds sang with might
and main: and blithely Robin whistled as he trudged along, thinking of
Maid Marian and her bright eyes, for at such times a youth&#8217;s thoughts
are wont to turn pleasantly upon the lass that he loves the best.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As thus he walked along with a brisk step and a merry whistle, he came
suddenly upon some foresters seated beneath a great oak tree. Fifteen
there were in all, making themselves merry with feasting and drinking as
they sat around a huge pasty, to which each man helped himself,
thrusting his hands into the pie, and washing down that which they ate
with great horns of ale which they drew all foaming from a barrel that
stood nigh. Each man was clad in Lincoln green, and a fine show they
made, seated upon the sward beneath that fair, spreading tree. Then one
of them, with his mouth full, called out to Robin, "Hulloa, where goest
thou, little lad, with thy one-penny bow and thy farthing shafts?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then Robin grew angry, for no stripling likes to be taunted with his
green years.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now," quoth he, "my bow and eke mine arrows are as good as shine; and
moreover, I go to the shooting match at Nottingham Town, which same has
been proclaimed by our good Sheriff of Nottinghamshire; there I will
shoot with other stout yeomen, for a prize has been offered of a fine
butt of ale."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then one who held a horn of ale in his hand said, "Ho! listen to the
lad! Why, boy, thy mother&#8217;s milk is yet scarce dry upon thy lips, and
yet thou pratest of standing up with good stout men at Nottingham butts,
thou who art scarce able to draw one string of a two-stone bow."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I&#8217;ll hold the best of you twenty marks," quoth bold Robin, "that I hit
the clout at threescore rods, by the good help of Our Lady fair."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this all laughed aloud, and one said, "Well boasted, thou fair
infant, well boasted! And well thou knowest that no target is nigh to
make good thy wager."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And another cried, "He will be taking ale with his milk next."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this Robin grew right mad. "Hark ye," said he, "yonder, at the
glade&#8217;s end, I see a herd of deer, even more than threescore rods
distant. I&#8217;ll hold you twenty marks that, by leave of Our Lady, I cause
the best hart among them to die."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now done!" cried he who had spoken first. "And here are twenty marks. I
wager that thou causest no beast to die, with or without the aid of Our
Lady."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then Robin took his good yew bow in his hand, and placing the tip at his
instep, he strung it right deftly; then he nocked a broad clothyard
arrow and, raising the bow, drew the gray goose feather to his ear; the
next moment the bowstring rang and the arrow sped down the glade as a
sparrowhawk skims in a northern wind. High leaped the noblest hart of
all the herd, only to fall dead, reddening the green path with his
heart&#8217;s blood.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ha!" cried Robin, "how likest thou that shot, good fellow? I wot the
wager were mine, an it were three hundred pounds."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then all the foresters were filled with rage, and he who had spoken the
first and had lost the wager was more angry than all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay," cried he, "the wager is none of thine, and get thee gone,
straightway, or, by all the saints of heaven, I&#8217;ll baste thy sides until
thou wilt ne&#8217;er be able to walk again." "Knowest thou not," said
another, "that thou hast killed the King&#8217;s deer, and, by the laws of our
gracious lord and sovereign King Harry, thine ears should be shaven
close to thy head?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Catch him!" cried a third.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay," said a fourth, "let him e&#8217;en go because of his tender years."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Never a word said Robin Hood, but he looked at the foresters with a grim
face; then, turning on his heel, strode away from them down the forest
glade. But his heart was bitterly angry, for his blood was hot and
youthful and prone to boil.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, well would it have been for him who had first spoken had he left
Robin Hood alone; but his anger was hot, both because the youth had
gotten the better of him and because of the deep draughts of ale that he
had been quaffing. So, of a sudden, without any warning, he sprang to
his feet, and seized upon his bow and fitted it to a shaft. "Ay," cried
he, "and I&#8217;ll hurry thee anon." And he sent the arrow whistling after
Robin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was well for Robin Hood that that same forester&#8217;s head was spinning
with ale, or else he would never have taken another step. As it was, the
arrow whistled within three inches of his head. Then he turned around
and quickly drew his own bow, and sent an arrow back in return.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ye said I was no archer," cried he aloud, "but say so now again!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The shaft flew straight; the archer fell forward with a cry, and lay on
his face upon the ground, his arrows rattling about him from out of his
quiver, the gray goose shaft wet with his; heart&#8217;s blood. Then, before
the others could gather their wits about them, Robin Hood was gone into
the depths of the greenwood. Some started after him, but not with much
heart, for each feared to suffer the death of his fellow; so presently
they all came and lifted the dead man up and bore him away to Nottingham
Town.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile Robin Hood ran through the greenwood. Gone was all the joy and
brightness from everything, for his heart was sick within him, and it
was borne in upon his soul that he had slain a man.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/004.jpg" alt="004 (117K)"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Alas!" cried he, "thou hast found me an archer that will make thy wife
to wring! I would that thou hadst ne&#8217;er said one word to me, or that I
had never passed thy way, or e&#8217;en that my right forefinger had been
stricken off ere that this had happened! In haste I smote, but grieve I
sore at leisure!" And then, even in his trouble, he remembered the old
saw that "What is done is done; and the egg cracked cannot be cured."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so he came to dwell in the greenwood that was to be his home for
many a year to come, never again to see the happy days with the lads and
lasses of sweet Locksley Town; for he was outlawed, not only because he
had killed a man, but also because he had poached upon the King&#8217;s deer,
and two hundred pounds were set upon his head, as a reward for whoever
would bring him to the court of the King.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the Sheriff of Nottingham swore that he himself would bring this
knave Robin Hood to justice, and for two reasons: first, because he
wanted the two hundred pounds, and next, because the forester that Robin
Hood had killed was of kin to him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But Robin Hood lay hidden in Sherwood Forest for one year, and in that
time there gathered around him many others like himself, cast out from
other folk for this cause and for that. Some had shot deer in hungry
wintertime, when they could get no other food, and had been seen in the
act by the foresters, but had escaped, thus saving their ears; some had
been turned out of their inheritance, that their farms might be added to
the King&#8217;s lands in Sherwood Forest; some had been despoiled by a great
baron or a rich abbot or a powerful esquire—all, for one cause or
another, had come to Sherwood to escape wrong and oppression.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, in all that year, fivescore or more good stout yeomen gathered about
Robin Hood, and chose him to be their leader and chief. Then they vowed
that even as they themselves had been despoiled they would despoil their
oppressors, whether baron, abbot, knight, or squire, and that from each
they would take that which had been wrung from the poor by unjust taxes,
or land rents, or in wrongful fines. But to the poor folk they would
give a helping hand in need and trouble, and would return to them that
which had been unjustly taken from them. Besides this, they swore never
to harm a child nor to wrong a woman, be she maid, wife, or widow; so
that, after a while, when the people began to find that no harm was
meant to them, but that money or food came in time of want to many a
poor family, they came to praise Robin and his merry men, and to tell
many tales of him and of his doings in Sherwood Forest, for they felt
him to be one of themselves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up rose Robin Hood one merry morn when all the birds were singing
blithely among the leaves, and up rose all his merry men, each fellow
washing his head and hands in the cold brown brook that leaped laughing
from stone to stone. Then said Robin, "For fourteen days have we seen no
sport, so now I will go abroad to seek adventures forthwith. But tarry
ye, my merry men all, here in the greenwood; only see that ye mind well
my call. Three blasts upon the bugle horn I will blow in my hour of
need; then come quickly, for I shall want your aid."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So saying, he strode away through the leafy forest glades until he had
come to the verge of Sherwood. There he wandered for a long time,
through highway and byway, through dingly dell and forest skirts. Now he
met a fair buxom lass in a shady lane, and each gave the other a merry
word and passed their way; now he saw a fair lady upon an ambling pad,
to whom he doffed his cap, and who bowed sedately in return to the fair
youth; now he saw a fat monk on a pannier-laden ass; now a gallant
knight, with spear and shield and armor that flashed brightly in the
sunlight; now a page clad in crimson; and now a stout burgher from good
Nottingham Town, pacing along with serious footsteps; all these sights
he saw, but adventure found he none. At last he took a road by the
forest skirts, a bypath that dipped toward a broad, pebbly stream
spanned by a narrow bridge made of a log of wood. As he drew nigh this
bridge he saw a tall stranger coming from the other side. Thereupon
Robin quickened his pace, as did the stranger likewise, each thinking to
cross first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now stand thou back," quoth Robin, "and let the better man cross
first."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay," answered the stranger, "then stand back shine own self, for the
better man, I wet, am I."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"That will we presently see," quoth Robin, "and meanwhile stand thou
where thou art, or else, by the bright brow of Saint AElfrida, I will
show thee right good Nottingham play with a clothyard shaft betwixt thy
ribs."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now," quoth the stranger, "I will tan thy hide till it be as many
colors as a beggar&#8217;s cloak, if thou darest so much as touch a string of
that same bow that thou holdest in thy hands."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Thou pratest like an ass," said Robin, "for I could send this shaft
clean through thy proud heart before a curtal friar could say grace over
a roast goose at Michaelmastide."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"And thou pratest like a coward," answered the stranger, "for thou
standest there with a good yew bow to shoot at my heart, while I have
nought in my hand but a plain blackthorn staff wherewith to meet thee."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now," quoth Robin, "by the faith of my heart, never have I had a
coward&#8217;s name in all my life before. I will lay by my trusty bow and eke
my arrows, and if thou darest abide my coming, I will go and cut a
cudgel to test thy manhood withal."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ay, marry, that will I abide thy coming, and joyously, too," quoth the
stranger; whereupon he leaned sturdily upon his staff to await Robin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then Robin Hood stepped quickly to the coverside and cut a good staff of
ground oak, straight, without new, and six feet in length, and came back
trimming away the tender stems from it, while the stranger waited for
him, leaning upon his staff, and whistling as he gazed round about.
Robin observed him furtively as he trimmed his staff, measuring him from
top to toe from out the corner of his eye, and thought that he had never
seen a lustier or a stouter man. Tall was Robin, but taller was the
stranger by a head and a neck, for he was seven feet in height. Broad
was Robin across the shoulders, but broader was the stranger by twice
the breadth of a palm, while he measured at least an ell around the
waist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nevertheless," said Robin to himself, "I will baste thy hide right
merrily, my good fellow"; then, aloud, "Lo, here is my good staff, lusty
and tough. Now wait my coming, an thou darest, and meet me an thou
fearest not. Then we will fight until one or the other of us tumble into
the stream by dint of blows."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Marry, that meeteth my whole heart!" cried the stranger, twirling his
staff above his head, betwixt his fingers and thumb, until it whistled
again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Never did the Knights of Arthur&#8217;s Round Table meet in a stouter fight
than did these two. In a moment Robin stepped quickly upon the bridge
where the stranger stood; first he made a feint, and then delivered a
blow at the stranger&#8217;s head that, had it met its mark, would have
tumbled him speedily into the water. But the stranger turned the blow
right deftly and in return gave one as stout, which Robin also turned as
the stranger had done. So they stood, each in his place, neither moving
a finger&#8217;s-breadth back, for one good hour, and many blows were given
and received by each in that time, till here and there were sore bones
and bumps, yet neither thought of crying "Enough," nor seemed likely to
fall from off the bridge. Now and then they stopped to rest, and each
thought that he never had seen in all his life before such a hand at
quarterstaff. At last Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that
made his jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun. So shrewd was
the stroke that the stranger came within a hair&#8217;s-breadth of falling off
the bridge, but he regained himself right quickly and, by a dexterous
blow, gave Robin a crack on the crown that caused the blood to flow.
Then Robin grew mad with anger and smote with all his might at the
other. But the stranger warded the blow and once again thwacked Robin,
and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the water, as
the queen pin falls in a game of bowls.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"And where art thou now, my good lad?" shouted the stranger, roaring
with laughter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Oh, in the flood and floating adown with the tide," cried Robin, nor
could he forbear laughing himself at his sorry plight. Then, gaining his
feet, he waded to the bank, the little fish speeding hither and thither,
all frightened at his splashing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Give me thy hand," cried he, when he had reached the bank. "I must
needs own thou art a brave and a sturdy soul and, withal, a good stout
stroke with the cudgels. By this and by that, my head hummeth like to a
hive of bees on a hot June day."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then he clapped his horn to his lips and winded a blast that went
echoing sweetly down the forest paths. "Ay, marry," quoth he again,
"thou art a tall lad, and eke a brave one, for ne&#8217;er, I bow, is there a
man betwixt here and Canterbury Town could do the like to me that thou
hast done."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"And thou," quoth the stranger, laughing, "takest thy cudgeling like a
brave heart and a stout yeoman."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But now the distant twigs and branches rustled with the coming of men,
and suddenly a score or two of good stout yeomen, all clad in Lincoln
green, burst from out the covert, with merry Will Stutely at their head.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Good master," cried Will, "how is this? Truly thou art all wet from
head to foot, and that to the very skin."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Why, marry," answered jolly Robin, "yon stout fellow hath tumbled me
neck and crop into the water and hath given me a drubbing beside."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Then shall he not go without a ducking and eke a drubbing himself!"
cried Will Stutely. "Have at him, lads!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then Will and a score of yeomen leaped upon the stranger, but though
they sprang quickly they found him ready and felt him strike right and
left with his stout staff, so that, though he went down with press of
numbers, some of them rubbed cracked crowns before he was overcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay, forbear!" cried Robin, laughing until his sore sides ached again.
"He is a right good man and true, and no harm shall befall him. Now hark
ye, good youth, wilt thou stay with me and be one of my band? Three
suits of Lincoln green shalt thou have each year, beside forty marks in
fee, and share with us whatsoever good shall befall us. Thou shalt eat
sweet venison and quaff the stoutest ale, and mine own good right-hand
man shalt thou be, for never did I see such a cudgel player in all my
life before. Speak! Wilt thou be one of my good merry men?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"That know I not," quoth the stranger surlily, for he was angry at being
so tumbled about. "If ye handle yew bow and apple shaft no better than
ye do oaken cudgel, I wot ye are not fit to be called yeomen in my
country; but if there be any man here that can shoot a better shaft than
I, then will I bethink me of joining with you."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now by my faith," said Robin, "thou art a right saucy varlet, sirrah;
yet I will stoop to thee as I never stooped to man before. Good Stutely,
cut thou a fair white piece of bark four fingers in breadth, and set it
fourscore yards distant on yonder oak. Now, stranger, hit that fairly
with a gray goose shaft and call thyself an archer."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ay, marry, that will I," answered he. "Give me a good stout bow and a
fair broad arrow, and if I hit it not, strip me and beat me blue with
bowstrings."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then he chose the stoutest bow among them all, next to Robin&#8217;s own, and
a straight gray goose shaft, well-feathered and smooth, and stepping to
the mark—while all the band, sitting or lying upon the greensward,
watched to see him shoot—he drew the arrow to his cheek and loosed the
shaft right deftly, sending it so straight down the path that it clove
the mark in the very center. "Aha!" cried he, "mend thou that if thou
canst"; while even the yeomen clapped their hands at so fair a shot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"That is a keen shot indeed," quoth Robin. "Mend it I cannot, but mar it
I may, perhaps."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then taking up his own good stout bow and nocking an arrow with care, he
shot with his very greatest skill. Straight flew the arrow, and so true
that it lit fairly upon the stranger&#8217;s shaft and split it into
splinters. Then all the yeomen leaped to their feet and shouted for joy
that their master had shot so well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now by the lusty yew bow of good Saint Withold," cried the stranger,
"that is a shot indeed, and never saw I the like in all my life before!
Now truly will I be thy man henceforth and for aye. Good Adam
Bell.<span class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</span> was a fair shot, but never shot he so!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Then have I gained a right good man this day," quoth jolly Robin. "What
name goest thou by, good fellow?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Men call me John Little whence I came," answered the stranger.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then Will Stutely, who loved a good jest, spoke up. "Nay, fair little
stranger," said he, "I like not thy name and fain would I have it
otherwise. Little art thou indeed, and small of bone and sinew,
therefore shalt thou be christened Little John, and I will be thy
godfather."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then Robin Hood and all his band laughed aloud until the stranger began
to grow angry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"An thou make a jest of me," quoth he to Will Stutely, "thou wilt have
sore bones and little pay, and that in short season."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay, good friend," said Robin Hood, "bottle thine anger, for the name
fitteth thee well. Little John shall thou be called henceforth, and
Little John shall it be. So come, my merry men, we will prepare a
christening feast for this fair infant."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So turning their backs upon the stream, they plunged into the forest
once more, through which they traced their steps till they reached the
spot where they dwelled in the depths of the woodland. There had they
built huts of bark and branches of trees, and made couches of sweet
rushes spread over with skins of fallow deer. Here stood a great oak
tree with branches spreading broadly around, beneath which was a seat of
green moss where Robin Hood was wont to sit at feast and at merrymaking
with his stout men about him. Here they found the rest of the band, some
of whom had come in with a brace of fat does. Then they all built great
fires and after a time roasted the does and broached a barrel of humming
ale. Then when the feast was ready they all sat down, but Robin placed
Little John at his right hand, for he was henceforth to be the second in
the band.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then when the feast was done Will Stutely spoke up. "It is now time, I
ween, to christen our bonny babe, is it not so, merry boys?" And "Aye!
Aye!" cried all, laughing till the woods echoed with their mirth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Then seven sponsors shall we have," quoth Will Stutely, and hunting
among all the band, he chose the seven stoutest men of them all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now by Saint Dunstan," cried Little John, springing to his feet, "more
than one of you shall rue it an you lay finger upon me."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But without a word they all ran upon him at once, seizing him by his
legs and arms and holding him tightly in spite of his struggles, and
they bore him forth while all stood around to see the sport. Then one
came forward who had been chosen to play the priest because he had a
bald crown, and in his hand he carried a brimming pot of ale. "Now, who
bringeth this babe?" asked he right soberly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"That do I," answered Will Stutely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"And what name callest thou him?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Little John call I him."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now Little John," quoth the mock priest, "thou hast not lived
heretofore, but only got thee along through the world, but henceforth
thou wilt live indeed. When thou livedst not thou wast called John
Little, but now that thou dost live indeed, Little John shalt thou be
called, so christen I thee." And at these last words he emptied the pot
of ale upon Little John&#8217;s head.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then all shouted with laughter as they saw the good brown ale stream
over Little John&#8217;s beard and trickle from his nose and chin, while his
eyes blinked with the smart of it. At first he was of a mind to be angry
but found he could not, because the others were so merry; so he, too,
laughed with the rest. Then Robin took this sweet, pretty babe, clothed
him all anew from top to toe in Lincoln green, and gave him a good stout
bow, and so made him a member of the merry band.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And thus it was that Robin Hood became outlawed; thus a band of merry
companions gathered about him, and thus he gained his right-hand man,
Little John; and so the prologue ends. And now I will tell how the
Sheriff of Nottingham three times sought to take Robin Hood, and how he
failed each time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/005b.jpg" alt="005b (31K)"></span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_robin_hood_and_the_tinker">Robin Hood and the Tinker</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NOW IT WAS TOLD BEFORE how two hundred pounds were set upon Robin Hood&#8217;s
head, and how the Sheriff of Nottingham swore that he himself would
seize Robin, both because he would fain have the two hundred pounds and
because the slain man was a kinsman of his own. Now the Sheriff did not
yet know what a force Robin had about him in Sherwood, but thought that
he might serve a warrant for his arrest as he could upon any other man
that had broken the laws; therefore he offered fourscore golden angels
to anyone who would serve this warrant. But men of Nottingham Town knew
more of Robin Hood and his doings than the Sheriff did, and many laughed
to think of serving a warrant upon the bold outlaw, knowing well that
all they would get for such service would be cracked crowns; so that no
one came forward to take the matter in hand. Thus a fortnight passed, in
which time none came forward to do the Sheriff&#8217;s business. Then said he,
"A right good reward have I offered to whosoever would serve my warrant
upon Robin Hood, and I marvel that no one has come to undertake the
task."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then one of his men who was near him said, "Good master, thou wottest
not the force that Robin Hood has about him and how little he cares for
warrant of king or sheriff. Truly, no one likes to go on this service,
for fear of cracked crowns and broken bones."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Then I hold all Nottingham men to be cowards," said the Sheriff. "And
let me see the man in all Nottinghamshire that dare disobey the warrant
of our sovereign lord King Harry, for, by the shrine of Saint Edmund, I
will hang him forty cubits high! But if no man in Nottingham dare win
fourscore angels, I will send elsewhere, for there should be men of
mettle somewhere in this land."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then he called up a messenger in whom he placed great trust, and bade
him saddle his horse and make ready to go to Lincoln Town to see whether
he could find anyone there that would do his bidding and win the reward.
So that same morning the messenger started forth upon his errand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bright shone the sun upon the dusty highway that led from Nottingham to
Lincoln, stretching away all white over hill and dale. Dusty was the
highway and dusty the throat of the messenger, so that his heart was
glad when he saw before him the Sign of the Blue Boar Inn, when somewhat
more than half his journey was done. The inn looked fair to his eyes,
and the shade of the oak trees that stood around it seemed cool and
pleasant, so he alighted from his horse to rest himself for a time,
calling for a pot of ale to refresh his thirsty throat.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There he saw a party of right jovial fellows seated beneath the
spreading oak that shaded the greensward in front of the door. There was
a tinker, two barefoot friars, and a party of six of the King&#8217;s
foresters all clad in Lincoln green, and all of them were quaffing
humming ale and singing merry ballads of the good old times. Loud
laughed the foresters, as jests were bandied about between the singing,
and louder laughed the friars, for they were lusty men with beards that
curled like the wool of black rams; but loudest of all laughed the
Tinker, and he sang more sweetly than any of the rest. His bag and his
hammer hung upon a twig of the oak tree, and near by leaned his good
stout cudgel, as thick as his wrist and knotted at the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Come," cried one of the foresters to the tired messenger, "come join us
for this shot. Ho, landlord! Bring a fresh pot of ale for each man."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The messenger was glad enough to sit down along with the others who were
there, for his limbs were weary and the ale was good.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now what news bearest thou so fast?" quoth one, "and whither ridest
thou today?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The messenger was a chatty soul and loved a bit of gossip dearly;
besides, the pot of ale warmed his heart; so that, settling himself in
an easy corner of the inn bench, while the host leaned upon the doorway
and the hostess stood with her hands beneath her apron, he unfolded his
budget of news with great comfort. He told all from the very first: how
Robin Hood had slain the forester, and how he had hidden in the
greenwood to escape the law; how that he lived therein, all against the
law, God wot, slaying His Majesty&#8217;s deer and levying toll on fat abbot,
knight, and esquire, so that none dare travel even on broad Watling
Street or the Fosse Way for fear of him; how that the Sheriff had a mind
to serve the King&#8217;s warrant upon this same rogue, though little would he
mind warrant of either king or sheriff, for he was far from being a law-
abiding man. Then he told how none could be found in all Nottingham Town
to serve this warrant, for fear of cracked pates and broken bones, and
how that he, the messenger, was now upon his way to Lincoln Town to find
of what mettle the Lincoln men might be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now come I, forsooth, from good Banbury Town," said the jolly Tinker,
"and no one nigh Nottingham—nor Sherwood either, an that be the mark—
can hold cudgel with my grip. Why, lads, did I not meet that mad wag
Simon of Ely, even at the famous fair at Hertford Town, and beat him in
the ring at that place before Sir Robert of Leslie and his lady? This
same Robin Hood, of whom, I wot, I never heard before, is a right merry
blade, but gin he be strong, am not I stronger? And gin he be sly, am
not I slyer? Now by the bright eyes of Nan o' the Mill, and by mine own
name and that&#8217;s Wat o' the Crabstaff, and by mine own mother&#8217;s son, and
that&#8217;s myself, will I, even I, Wat o' the Crabstaff, meet this same
sturdy rogue, and gin he mind not the seal of our glorious sovereign
King Harry, and the warrant of the good Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, I
will so bruise, beat, and bemaul his pate that he shall never move
finger or toe again! Hear ye that, bully boys?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now art thou the man for my farthing," cried the messenger. "And back
thou goest with me to Nottingham Town."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="images/005a.jpg" alt="005a (141K)"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay," quoth the Tinker, shaking his head slowly from side to side. "Go
I with no man gin it be not with mine own free will."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay, nay," said the messenger, "no man is there in Nottinghamshire
could make thee go against thy will, thou brave fellow."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ay, that be I brave," said the Tinker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ay, marry," said the messenger, "thou art a brave lad; but our good
Sheriff hath offered fourscore angels of bright gold to whosoever shall
serve the warrant upon Robin Hood; though little good will it do."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Then I will go with thee, lad. Do but wait till I get my bag and
hammer, and my cudgel. Ay, let' me but meet this same Robin Hood, and
let me see whether he will not mind the King&#8217;s warrant." So, after
having paid their score, the messenger, with the Tinker striding beside
his nag, started back to Nottingham again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One bright morning soon after this time, Robin Hood started off to
Nottingham Town to find what was a-doing there, walking merrily along
the roadside where the grass was sweet with daisies, his eyes wandering
and his thoughts also. His bugle horn hung at his hip and his bow and
arrows at his back, while in his hand he bore a good stout oaken staff,
which he twirled with his fingers as he strolled along.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As thus he walked down a shady lane he saw a tinker coming, trolling a
merry song as he drew nigh. On his back hung his bag and his hammer, and
in his hand he carried a right stout crabstaff full six feet long, and
thus sang he:</p>
</div>
<div class="verseblock">
<pre class="content">"In peascod time, when hound to horn
Gives ear till buck be killed,
And little lads with pipes of corn
Sit keeping beasts afield—"</pre>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Halloa, good friend!" cried Robin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I WENT TO GATHER STRAWBERRIES—"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Halloa!" cried Robin again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"BY WOODS AND GROVES FULL FAIR—"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Halloa! Art thou deaf, man? Good friend, say I!" "And who art thou dost
so boldly check a fair song?" quoth the Tinker, stopping in his singing.
"Halloa, shine own self, whether thou be good friend or no. But let me
tell thee, thou stout fellow, gin thou be a good friend it were well for
us both; but gin thou be no good friend it were ill for thee."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"And whence comest thou, my lusty blade?" quoth Robin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I come from Banbury," answered the Tinker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Alas!" quoth Robin, "I hear there is sad news this merry morn."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ha! Is it indeed so?" cried the Tinker eagerly. "Prythee tell it
speedily, for I am a tinker by trade, as thou seest, and as I am in my
trade I am greedy for news, even as a priest is greedy for farthings."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Well then," quoth Robin, "list thou and I will tell, but bear thyself
up bravely, for the news is sad, I wot. Thus it is: I hear that two
tinkers are in the stocks for drinking ale and beer!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now a murrain seize thee and thy news, thou scurvy dog," quoth the
Tinker, "for thou speakest but ill of good men. But sad news it is
indeed, gin there be two stout fellows in the stocks."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay," said Robin, "thou hast missed the mark and dost but weep for the
wrong sow. The sadness of the news lieth in that there be but two in the
stocks, for the others do roam the country at large."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now by the pewter platter of Saint Dunstan," cried the Tinker, "I have
a good part of a mind to baste thy hide for thine ill jest. But gin men
be put in the stocks for drinking ale and beer, I trow thou wouldst not
lose thy part."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Loud laughed Robin and cried, "Now well taken, Tinker, well taken! Why,
thy wits are like beer, and do froth up most when they grow sour! But
right art thou, man, for I love ale and beer right well. Therefore come
straightway with me hard by to the Sign of the Blue Boar, and if thou
drinkest as thou appearest—and I wot thou wilt not belie thy looks—I
will drench thy throat with as good homebrewed as ever was tapped in all
broad Nottinghamshire."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now by my faith," said the Tinker, "thou art a right good fellow in
spite of thy scurvy jests. I love thee, my sweet chuck, and gin I go not
with thee to that same Blue Boar thou mayst call me a heathen."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Tell me thy news, good friend, I prythee," quoth Robin as they trudged
along together, "for tinkers, I ween, are all as full of news as an egg
of meat."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now I love thee as my brother, my bully blade," said the Tinker, "else
I would not tell thee my news; for sly am I, man, and I have in hand a
grave undertaking that doth call for all my wits, for I come to seek a
bold outlaw that men, hereabouts, call Robin Hood. Within my pouch I
have a warrant, all fairly written out on parchment, forsooth, with a
great red seal for to make it lawful. Could I but meet this same Robin
Hood I would serve it upon his dainty body, and if he minded it not I
would beat him till every one of his ribs would cry Amen. But thou
livest hereabouts, mayhap thou knowest Robin Hood thyself, good fellow."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ay, marry, that I do somewhat," quoth Robin, "and I have seen him this
very morn. But, Tinker, men say that he is but a sad, sly thief. Thou
hadst better watch thy warrant, man, or else he may steal it out of thy
very pouch."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Let him but try!" cried the Tinker. "Sly may he be, but sly am I, too.
I would I had him here now, man to man!" And he made his heavy cudgel to
spin again. "But what manner of man is he, lad?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Much like myself," said Robin, laughing, "and in height and build and
age nigh the same; and he hath blue eyes, too."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay," quoth the Tinker, "thou art but a green youth. I thought him to
be a great bearded man. Nottingham men feared him so."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Truly, he is not so old nor so stout as thou art," said Robin. "But men
do call him a right deft hand at quarterstaff."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"That may be," said the Tinker right sturdily, "but I am more deft than
he, for did I not overcome Simon of Ely in a fair bout in the ring at
Hertford Town? But if thou knowest him, my jolly blade, wilt thou go
with me and bring me to him? Fourscore bright angels hath the Sheriff
promised me if I serve the warrant upon the knave&#8217;s body, and ten of
them will I give to thee if thou showest me him."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ay, that will I," quoth Robin, "but show me thy warrant, man, until I
see whether it be good or no."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"That will I not do, even to mine own brother," answered the Tinker. "No
man shall see my warrant till I serve it upon yon fellow&#8217;s own body."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"So be it," quoth Robin. "And thou show it not to me I know not to whom
thou wilt show it. But here we are at the Sign of the Blue Boar, so let
us in and taste his brown October."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No sweeter inn could be found in all Nottinghamshire than that of the
Blue Boar. None had such lovely trees standing around, or was so covered
with trailing clematis and sweet woodbine; none had such good beer and
such humming ale; nor, in wintertime, when the north wind howled and
snow drifted around the hedges, was there to be found, elsewhere, such a
roaring fire as blazed upon the hearth of the Blue Boar. At such times
might be found a goodly company of yeomen or country folk seated around
the blazing hearth, bandying merry jests, while roasted crabs.<span class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</span> bobbed in bowls of ale upon the hearthstone. Well known was the
inn to Robin Hood and his band, for there had he and such merry
companions as Little John or Will Stutely or young David of Doncaster
often gathered when all the forest was filled with snow. As for mine
host, he knew how to keep a still tongue in his head, and to swallow his
words before they passed his teeth, for he knew very well which side of
his bread was spread with butter, for Robin and his band were the best
of customers and paid their scores without having them chalked up behind
the door. So now, when Robin Hood and the Tinker came thereto and called
aloud for two great pots of ale, none would have known from look or
speech that the host had ever set eyes upon the outlaw before.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Bide thou here," quoth Robin to the Tinker, "while I go and see that
mine host draweth ale from the right butt, for he hath good October, I
know, and that brewed by Withold of Tamworth." So saying, he went within
and whispered to the host to add a measure of Flemish strong waters to
the good English ale; which the latter did and brought it to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"By Our Lady," said the Tinker, after a long draught of the ale, "yon
same Withold of Tamworth—a right good Saxon name, too, I would have thee
know—breweth the most humming ale that e&#8217;er passed the lips of Wat o'
the Crabstaff."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Drink, man, drink," cried Robin, only wetting his own lips meanwhile.
"Ho, landlord! Bring my friend another pot of the same. And now for a
song, my jolly blade."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ay, that will I give thee a song, my lovely fellow," quoth the Tinker,
"for I never tasted such ale in all my days before. By Our Lady, it doth
make my head hum even now! Hey, Dame Hostess, come listen, an thou
wouldst hear a song, and thou too, thou bonny lass, for never sing I so
well as when bright eyes do look upon me the while."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then he sang an ancient ballad of the time of good King Arthur, called
"The Marriage of Sir Gawaine," which you may some time read yourself, in
stout English of early times; and as he sang, all listened to that noble
tale of noble knight and his sacrifice to his king. But long before the
Tinker came to the last verse his tongue began to trip and his head to
spin, because of the strong waters mixed with the ale. First his tongue
tripped, then it grew thick of sound; then his head wagged from side to
side, until at last he fell asleep as though he never would waken again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then Robin Hood laughed aloud and quickly took the warrant from out the
Tinker&#8217;s pouch with his deft fingers. "Sly art thou, Tinker," quoth he,
"but not yet, I bow, art thou as sly as that same sly thief Robin Hood."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then he called the host to him and said, "Here, good man, are ten broad
shillings for the entertainment thou hast given us this day. See that
thou takest good care of thy fair guest there, and when he wakes thou
mayst again charge him ten shillings also, and if he hath it not, thou
mayst take his bag and hammer, and even his coat, in payment. Thus do I
punish those that come into the greenwood to deal dole to me. As for
thine own self, never knew I landlord yet that would not charge twice an
he could."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this the host smiled slyly, as though saying to himself the rustic
saw, "Teach a magpie to suck eggs."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Tinker slept until the afternoon drew to a close and the shadows
grew long beside the woodland edge, then he awoke. First he looked up,
then he looked down, then he looked east, then he looked west, for he
was gathering his wits together, like barley straws blown apart by the
wind. First he thought of his merry companion, but he was gone. Then he
thought of his stout crabstaff, and that he had within his hand. Then of
his warrant, and of the fourscore angels he was to gain for serving it
upon Robin Hood. He thrust his hand into his pouch, but not a scrap nor
a farthing was there. Then he sprang to his feet in a rage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ho, landlord!" cried he, "whither hath that knave gone that was with me
but now?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"What knave meaneth Your Worship?" quoth the landlord, calling the
Tinker Worship to soothe him, as a man would pour oil upon angry water.
"I saw no knave with Your Worship, for I swear no man would dare call
that man knave so nigh to Sherwood Forest. A right stout yeoman I saw
with Your Worship, but I thought that Your Worship knew him, for few
there be about here that pass him by and know him not."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now, how should I, that ne&#8217;er have squealed in your sty, know all the
swine therein? Who was he, then, an thou knowest him so well?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Why, yon same is a right stout fellow whom men hereabouts do call Robin
Hood, which same—"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now, by&#8217;r Lady!" cried the Tinker hastily, and in a deep voice like an
angry bull, "thou didst see me come into thine inn, I, a staunch, honest
craftsman, and never told me who my company was, well knowing thine own
self who he was. Now, I have a right round piece of a mind to crack thy
knave&#8217;s pate for thee!" Then he took up his cudgel and looked at the
landlord as though he would smite him where he stood.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay," cried the host, throwing up his elbow, for he feared the blow,
"how knew I that thou knewest him not?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Well and truly thankful mayst thou be," quoth the Tinker, "that I be a
patient man and so do spare thy bald crown, else wouldst thou ne&#8217;er
cheat customer again. But as for this same knave Robin Hood, I go
straightway to seek him, and if I do not score his knave&#8217;s pate, cut my
staff into fagots and call me woman." So saying, he gathered himself
together to depart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay," quoth the landlord, standing in front of him and holding out his
arms like a gooseherd driving his flock, for money made him bold, "thou
goest not till thou hast paid me my score."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"But did not he pay thee?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Not so much as one farthing; and ten good shillings' worth of ale have
ye drunk this day. Nay, I say, thou goest not away without paying me,
else shall our good Sheriff know of it."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"But nought have I to pay thee with, good fellow," quoth the Tinker.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"'Good fellow' not me," said the landlord. "Good fellow am I not when it
cometh to lose ten shillings! Pay me that thou owest me in broad money,
or else leave thy coat and bag and hammer; yet, I wot they are not worth
ten shillings, and I shall lose thereby. Nay, an thou stirrest, I have a
great dog within and I will loose him upon thee. Maken, open thou the
door and let forth Brian if this fellow stirs one step."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay," quoth the Tinker—for, by roaming the country, he had learned what
dogs were—"take thou what thou wilt have, and let me depart in peace,
and may a murrain go with thee. But oh, landlord! An I catch yon scurvy
varlet, I swear he shall pay full with usury for that he hath had!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So saying, he strode away toward the forest, talking to himself, while
the landlord and his worthy dame and Maken stood looking after him, and
laughed when he had fairly gone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Robin and I stripped yon ass of his pack main neatly," quoth the
landlord.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now it happened about this time that Robin Hood was going through the
forest to Fosse Way, to see what was to be seen there, for the moon was
full and the night gave promise of being bright. In his hand he carried
his stout oaken staff, and at his side hung his bugle horn. As thus he
walked up a forest path, whistling, down another path came the Tinker,
muttering to himself and shaking his head like an angry bull; and so, at
a sudden bend, they met sharply face to face. Each stood still for a
time, and then Robin spoke:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Halloa, my sweet bird," said he, laughing merrily, "how likest thou
thine ale? Wilt not sing to me another song?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Tinker said nothing at first but stood looking at Robin with a grim
face. "Now," quoth he at last, "I am right glad I have met thee, and if
I do not rattle thy bones within thy hide this day, I give thee leave to
put thy foot upon my neck."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"With all my heart," cried merry Robin. "Rattle my bones, an thou
canst." So saying, he gripped his staff and threw himself upon his
guard. Then the Tinker spat upon his hands and, grasping his staff, came
straight at the other. He struck two or three blows, but soon found that
he had met his match, for Robin warded and parried all of them, and,
before the Tinker thought, he gave him a rap upon the ribs in return. At
this Robin laughed aloud, and the Tinker grew more angry than ever, and
smote again with all his might and main. Again Robin warded two of the
strokes, but at the third, his staff broke beneath the mighty blows of
the Tinker. "Now, ill betide thee, traitor staff," cried Robin, as it
fell from his hands; "a foul stick art thou to serve me thus in mine
hour of need."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Now yield thee," quoth the Tinker, "for thou art my captive; and if
thou do not, I will beat thy pate to a pudding."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To this Robin Hood made no answer, but, clapping his horn to his lips,
he blew three blasts, loud and clear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ay," quoth the Tinker, "blow thou mayest, but go thou must with me to
Nottingham Town, for the Sheriff would fain see thee there. Now wilt
thou yield thee, or shall I have to break thy pretty head?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"An I must drink sour ale, I must," quoth Robin, "but never have I
yielded me to man before, and that without wound or mark upon my body.
Nor, when I bethink me, will I yield now. Ho, my merry men! Come
quickly!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then from out the forest leaped Little John and six stout yeomen clad in
Lincoln green.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"How now, good master," cried Little John, "what need hast thou that
thou dost wind thy horn so loudly?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"There stands a tinker," quoth Robin, "that would fain take me to
Nottingham, there to hang upon the gallows tree."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Then shall he himself hang forthwith," cried Little John, and he and
the others made at the Tinker, to seize him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Nay, touch him not," said Robin, "for a right stout man is he. A metal
man he is by trade, and a mettled man by nature; moreover, he doth sing
a lovely ballad. Say, good fellow, wilt thou join my merry men all?
Three suits of Lincoln green shalt thou have a year, besides forty marks
in fee; thou shalt share all with us and lead a right merry life in the
greenwood; for cares have we not, and misfortune cometh not upon us
within the sweet shades of Sherwood, where we shoot the dun deer and
feed upon venison and sweet oaten cakes, and curds and honey. Wilt thou
come with me?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Ay, marry, will I join with you all," quoth the Tinker, "for I love a
merry life, and I love thee, good master, though thou didst thwack my
ribs and cheat me into the bargain. Fain am I to own thou art both a
stouter and a slyer man than I; so I will obey thee and be thine own
true servant."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So all turned their steps to the forest depths, where the Tinker was to
live henceforth. For many a day he sang ballads to the band, until the
famous Allan a Dale joined them, before whose sweet voice all others
seemed as harsh as a raven&#8217;s; but of him we will learn hereafter.</p>
